1 -> I built a Todo List in React to apply my learnings. Here are my key takeaways:

Top Learnings

 1.useState with Arrays/Objects – Managed complex states efficiently, handling tasks as an array of objects.
 2.UUIDV4 for Unique IDs – Ensured reliable task operations like Add, Delete, and Update.
 3.React & JS Essentials – Used the spread operator, ternary operator, and array methods (map, filter) effectively.
 4.Arrow Function Returns –
	•	Explicit Return: ()=>{} requires return for output.
	•	Implicit Return: ()=>() auto-returns the value.

 2 -> FakeWhatsApp - Chat Application (Express & MongoDB)

Developed a full-stack chat app using Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS for real-time messaging. 

Key Highlights:

1.CRUD Operations – Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete for chat messages.
2.MongoDB Integration – Used Mongoose for efficient database operations.
3.Robust Error Handling – Implemented a centralized error-handling middleware using ExpressError, try-catch, and next().
4.Method Override – Enabled PUT & DELETE requests for RESTful API compliance.
5.Dynamic UI with EJS – Built interactive pages with EJS templates.
6.Asynchronous Operations – Used async/await for non-blocking database interactions.
